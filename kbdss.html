    <p>In the partition deed of Kodoth Tharawad nearly one thousand acres were allotted to Kodoth Devaswsam. But almost all properties were lost since the tenants became the absolute owners of the property as per the Land Reforms Act.
      So, practically there were no income for  maintenance of temple, Tharavad house and conducting poojas, Kaliyattam and other festivals. Moreover after partition three was no responsible person to look into these matters.
      Under this situation Adv.K.N. Kodoth(father of former Acting Chief Justice of Kerala, Justice V.P. Mohan Kumar and brother in law of former Chief Justice of Kerala Justice V.P.Gopalan Nambiar) took the initiative with the like minded members of the Tharawad and formed Kodoth Bhagavathi Devastapana Samrakshana Samithi (KBDSS). Now K.B.D.S.S is supervising all the functions..
